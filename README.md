# Overview

This is an application that allows the user to draw anything! There are a variety of colors the user can pick from, along with a brush size feature where the user can change the thickness of their lines. There is an additional feature where you may enter a title for your artwork on the opening window in this app. At any point in the drawing this title may be changed. 

This was created for entertainment purposes and to further my knowledge of python and mobile app development
